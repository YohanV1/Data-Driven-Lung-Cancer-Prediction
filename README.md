# Abstract
The diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer have made significant advancements in recent years, with the introduction of targeted chemotherapy and precise radiotherapy techniques. However, improving the survival rate of lung cancer patients remains a major challenge. To address the challenge of improving the survival rate of lung cancer patients, we have developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of developing lung cancer based on various risk factors and biomarkers. This model utilizes a combination of supervised learning algorithms to analyze patient data and identify patterns that may indicate the presence of lung cancer. By training the model on a diverse dataset of patient records, genetic information, and medical imaging results, we aim to improve the accuracy of early detection and provide personalized treatment recommendations. Our approach integrates features such as tumor size, location, and histology, as well as patient demographics and lifestyle factors to create a comprehensive and robust predictive tool. The machine learning model holds the potential to revolutionize the way lung cancer is diagnosed and managed, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and enhanced overall survival rates.
